# Investigating Customer Segmentation for Arvato Financial Services

## Project Motivation

The goal of this project is to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for a mail-order sales company in Germany.

##Introduction
In this project, you will analyze demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it against demographics information for the general population. You'll use unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation, identifying the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company. Then, you'll apply what you've learned on a third dataset with demographics information for targets of a marketing campaign for the company, and use a model to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company. The data that you will use has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.

In this blog, we dive into a real life machine learning project provided by Arvato Financial Solutions, a Bertelsmann subsidiary:
- Investigated Demographics data of general population of Germany and data for customers of a mail-order company.
- Preprocessed the dataset based on column/feature property.
- Apply Unsupervised Learning Algorithms, namely PCA and KMeans to segment the population (into different clusters) to recommend the potential customers for the company.
- Took a deeper look at two main clusters and compare them by checking the differences of several randomly choose features.
- Apply Supervised Learning to predict whether or not a person became a customer of the company following the campaign.
- Investigate the most important feature trained by machine learning model and compare the feature distribution between target/non-target population.
